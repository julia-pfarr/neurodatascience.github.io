Background: The deep phenotyping of populations is increasingly being used to investigate how the brain, behavior, genetics, and clinical outcomes interact. Through the collaborative collection of large samples, like the UK Biobank (UKBB), the methods and interpretation of these kinds of datasets can be reported and applied to real world outcomes. For example, large population samples like the UKBB can be used to contrast and augment the interpretation of a clinical sample, like the Quebec Parkinson's Network (QPN) or the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

The analysis of these kinds of large datasets also requires the processing to extract the most useful features for further analysis. In order for these features to be useful to the greater community, these processes need to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interpretable, and Reproducible). This existing need motivates much of the ongoing work for these projects.

Methods: My work revolves around contributing high quality derivatives across multiple datasets (UKBB, QPN, PPMI). This involves utilizing current standard preprocessing tools for MRI data, like fMRIPrep and TractoFlow. The analysis, quality control, and indexing of these derivatives is being contributed through other ongoing projects in the lab, namely mr_proc and Neurobagel.

My goal with creating these higher quality imaging derivatives is combine them with other physiological phenotypes in the sample (genetics, behavior, clinical status, etc.) to imrpove the detection and understanding of the changes during transition toward a disease.
