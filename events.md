title: NeuroImaging Statistics - July 27th 2023 - Montreal Neurological Institute
---

## NeuroImaging Statistics Satellite 
We’re pleased to announce a satellite event to the 2023 Organisation for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) meeting, the Neuroimaging Statistics Workshop, as a means to foster collaboration and generate ideas among statisticians working with brain data.

The event will take place at the Montreal Neurological Institute on Thursday 27th July (the day after the close of OHBM).  There will be 4 keynote speakers, starting with the Keith Worsley lecture delivered by Jonathan Taylor, Keith’s prolific student and author of the seminal text “Random Fields and Geometry” with Robert J. Adler.  

## Attend or contribute

#### We have space for 8 contributed lectures please use [this link](https://forms.gle/YraFS9AVLPozjwZY9) to attend or contribute.
