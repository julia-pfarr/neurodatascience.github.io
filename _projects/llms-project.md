# Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) are generative AI models that are able to
produce natural language text interactively with users. By interacting
with LLMs in a programmatic way, there are a variety of data
summarization and extraction processes that can be reliably
automated. We are exploring possibilities of extracting study specific
data for conducting meta-analyses.

In general, we are looking to establish expertise working with this
increasingly popular and transformative technology so we can
understand how to safely and ethically incorporate it into our work.

# Projects

- [reviewer2go](https://github.com/bcmcpher/reviewer2go): a series of prompts and queries for producing a simple
  report of the
  [COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728)
  criteria from a published paper.
- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Internship: we have proposed and hope
  to supervise 2 different GSoC interns working on incorporating LLM
  features into
  [NeuroBagel](https://www.neurobagel.org/documentation/) as part of
  the annotation and query process.
