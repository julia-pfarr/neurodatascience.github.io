From the 18th to 22nd of January, 2021, the **[NeuroDataScience ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/)** lab, the **McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience**, **HBHL’s NeuroHub**, **ReproNim**, and **UNIQUE** will hold a workshop entitled “*Machine Learning for the Cognitive Neurosciences*”, whose objective will be to introduce researchers to both the conceptual and practical rudiments of machine learning as applied to neuroimaging. See the schedule below.  

Though attendees are expected to have a general familiarity with brain imaging and conventional statistical analyses, the first two days introduce attendees to the software environment that will serve for the practical exercises during the workshop, including some basics of the Linux command line (Bash), Git, the Python programming language, and several Python-based packages for scientific computing, courtesy of [Calcul Québec](http://www.calculquebec.ca/).  

The core content will be presented over the remaining days. Our first speaker, Dr. Tal Yarkoni (University of Texas at Austin) will discuss the scientific applications of machine learning in brain imaging. Our second speaker, Dr. Ella Gabitov (McGill University), will present on the explanatory power and limitations of machine learning when applied to cognitive neuroscience. Throughout the workshop, hands-on tutorials will be presented by Alexandre Hutton (ORIGAMI, McGill), which will focus on giving participants an understanding of core concepts and common practices in machine learning.

### Schedule:  
**Groups**:  
To better support participants in the initial days of the workshop, the groups are split into two. If you registered for the Python intro on Monday, you are in Group 1. Otherwise, you are in Group 2.  
  
To set up your environment, follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT2Zb_WuIjpxq2Zw5kZSgE-g88JeRQi4UmYVFIJgO-M/edit?usp=sharing); we recommend that you do this ahead of time (est. 15min). Contact us via Slack if you'd like some help (check your email for the invitation).
