### Overview

Our ability to model disease mechanisms, outcomes, and treatment responses remains limited due to variability across studies and global populations. As clinical research studies gather large sample sizes, collecting, curating, and processing high-quality data from under-represented populations and regions becomes an important challenge. `ParkCore` is an initiative to integrate global data silos to improve global Parkinson research through federated setup and adoption of tools and best practices for open and reproducible science.

### Neuroinformatic Tools

We are actively deploying and supporting the following complementary tools to help researchers and clinicians in hospitals to standardize their data workflows. These tools are aimed at lowering the technical barrier to adoption for clinical researchers - empowering them with the best practices for enhancing transparency and commensurability of their research.

- [Nipoppy](https://neurobagel.org/nipoppy/overview/): A framework for organizing and processing neuroimaging datasets
- [Neurobagel](https://neurobagel.org/): Decentralized data harmonization and search
