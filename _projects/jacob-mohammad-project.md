We are exploring the correlation between Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) produced by MRIQC with the discrepancy in left hippocampal volumes and segmentations produced by FSL, FreeSurfer, and ASHS pipelines.
This should tell us whether MRI image quality affects agreements in pipeline results. We have done it for Prevent-AD and found no strong correlations, and will do it for two further datasets.
