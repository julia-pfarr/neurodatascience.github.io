# Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) are generative AI models that are able to
produce natural language text interactively with users. By interacting
with LLMs in a programmatic way, there are a variety of data
summarization and extraction processes that can be reliably
automated. We are exploring possibilities of extracting study specific
data for conducting meta-analyses.

In general, we are looking to establish expertise working with this
increasingly popular and transformative technology, so we can
understand how to safely and ethically incorporate it into our work.

# Projects

- [reviewer2go](https://github.com/bcmcpher/reviewer2go): a series of prompts and queries for producing a simple
  report of the
  [COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3728)
  criteria from a published paper.
- [litmining](https://litmining.github.io/) ecosystem: A set of accessible, scalable, and reliable tools for mining the biomedical literature.
- [biomed-llm-retrieval](https://github.com/litmining/biomed-llm-retrieval): This repo is built by our collaborator Alejandro de la Vega (U. Texis at Austin); it uses LLMs to extract annotations from the abstract/texts of biomedical papers, with a focus on fMRI.
