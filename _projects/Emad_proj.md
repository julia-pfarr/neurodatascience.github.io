Functional Connectivity (FC), defined as the temporal dependencies between the spatially segregated regions of brain., is a way to quantify the functional interactions among the regions. It can also be used as a potential biomarker. 
My goal is to…
1.	Compare the results of common task-FC assessment methods using simulated and experimental data. The comparison would be across different modalities (fMRI, EEG,…), task-paradigms, noise levels.
2.	bridge the gap between the task-based FC and dynamic FC, or in other words, study the temporal variations (dynamics) of task-based functional connectivity, using a time-varying multivariate autoregressive (TV-MVAR) model. The ability of the methods to adapt the transient changes will be investigated, in here.
3.	Investigate the changes in FC from the long-term iEEG using epilepsy dataset which will finally lead to seizure onset prediction.
